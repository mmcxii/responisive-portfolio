                        Hello! My name is Nich (short for Nicholas), I have been writing code for
                        almost a year now and I enjoy it more and more each day. I started this
                        process on a whim last September by taking a Programing 109 course at
                        Bellevue College. Never before had a class motivated me to work and study so
                        easily, I was hooked. In the months leading up to this course I have been
                        learning whatever I can on my own, but I am very much looking forward to
                        formal training with structure to ensure I don't miss anything important.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Outside of school my enjoy spending time with my friends, girlfriend, and
                        family doing just about anything, I'm not picky. My favorite pastimes
                        include skiing (above all else), hiking, food and drink (namely beer,
                        bourbon, and wine), traveling and playing both video and card games.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The parts of Web Development that I enjoy most so far are front-end and
                        design oriented but I want to become more familiar with the back-end
                        processes as well as making complex applications with JS. I know I have so
                        much to learn and I can't wait to get started!
                    </p>
